VEHICLE MODELS:

This submission contains a set of models created with Simulink and Powertrain Blockset.
More specifically, the files contaned include: vehicle dynamics model (glider), battery 
electric vehicle (BEV) model, and a conventional vehicle model.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE MODELS:

These models show how to represent vehicle dynamics and specific components using a power loss approach
in Simulink. They also show how to model components using Powertrain Blockset. 
All demos in this entry reinforce the concepts reviewed in the Vehicle Modeling video series. The models 
also show how to implement such concepts in the Simulink canvas.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:

The Simulink models use the following MathWorks products, all from R2017b release:
1)MATLAB
2)Simulink
3)Stateflow

The Powertrain Blockset models use the following MathWorks products, all from R2017b release:
1)MATLAB
2)Simulink
3)Stateflow
4)Powertrain Blockset
5)Aerospace Blockset

If the listed products are not installed on your machine, the models will not run.
